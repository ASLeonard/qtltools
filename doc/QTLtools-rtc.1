.SH DESCRIPTION
The RTC algorithm assesses the likelihood of a shared functional effect between a GWAS variant and an molQTL by quantifying the change in the statistical significance of the molQTL after correcting the molQTL phenotype for the genetic effect of the GWAS variant and comparing its correction impact to that of all other SNPs in the interval.
The method is detailed in <https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3981>.
When assessing tissue specificity of molQTLs we use the same method, however in that case the GWAS variant becomes an molQTL in a different tissue.
The RTC method is as follows: for a GWAS variant falling into the same region flanked by recombination hotspots (coldspot) with an molQTL, with N number of variants in a given coldspot:
.IP 1
Correct the phenotype for each of the variants in the region separately by linear regression, resulting in N number of pseudo-phenotypes (residuals).
.IP 2
Redo the molQTL variant association with all of these pseudo\-phenotypes.
.IP 3
Sort (decreasing) the resulting p\-values and find the rank of the molQTL to GWAS-pseudo-phenotype among all molQTL to pseudo\-phenotype associations.
.IP 4
RTC = (N \- Rank of GWAS) / N
.PP
This results in the RTC score which ranges from 0 to 1 where higher values indicate a more likely shared functional effect between the GWAS and the molQTL variants.
An RTC score greater than or equal to 0.9 is considered a shared functional effect.
If there are multiple independent molQTLs for a given phenotype, RTC for each independent molQTL is assessed after correcting the phenotype with all the other molQTL variants for that phenotype.
This correction is done using linear regression and taking the residuals after regressing the phenotype with the other molQTLs.
.PP
In order to convert RTC score into a probability of sharing, we employ two simulations per coldspot region, H0 and H1.
The H0 scenario is when two variants in a coldspot are tagging different functional effects.
For a coldspot that harbours colocalized GWAS and molQTL variants, we pick two random hidden causal variants. 
We then find two variants (GWAS and molQTL) that are linked (default r-squared â‰¥ 0.5) to the hidden causal variants.
We generate a pseudo phenotype for molQTL based on the slope and intercept of the observed molQTL and randomly distributed residuals of the observed molQTL.
Subsequently we rerun the RTC analysis with this new pseudo-phenotype and using the GWAS and molQTL variants.
.PP
The H1 scenario is when the two variants are tagging the same functional variant. 
The scheme here is exactly the same as the H0 scheme, except there is only one hidden causal variant and both GWAS and molQTL variants are randomly selected from variants that are linked to the same hidden causal variant.

.B \-\-vcf [\fIin.vcf\fR|\fIin.bcf\fR|\fIin.vcf.gz\fB|\fIin.bed.gz\fB]
Genotypes in VCF/BCF format, or another molecular phenotype in BED format.
If there is a DS field in the genotype FORMAT of a variant (dosage of the genotype calculated from genotype probabilities, e.g. after imputation), then this is used as the genotype.
If there is only the GT field in the genotype FORMAT then this is used and it is converted to a dosage.

.IP o 2
RTC with GWAS variants and cis-eQTLs and simulations, correcting for technical covariates, rank normal transforming the phenotype, and running conditional analysis while keeping data in memory.
To facilitate parallelization on compute cluster, we developed an option to run the analysis into chunks of molecular phenotypes.
For instance, to run analysis on chunk 12 when splitting the example data set into 20 chunks, run:
.IP "" 2
QTLtools rtc \-\-vcf genotypes.chr22.vcf.gz \-\-bed genes.50percent.chr22.bed.gz \-\-cov genes.covariates.pc50.txt.gz \-\-hotspot hotspots_b37_hg19.bed \-\-gwas-cis GWAS.b37.txt conditional_all.significant.txt \-\-normal \-\-conditional \-\-mem 2 \-\-chunk 12 20 \-\-sample 200 \-\-out rtc_results_12_20.txt  
.IP o 2
If you want to submit the whole analysis with 20 jobs on a compute cluster, just run (qsub needs to be changed to the job submission system used [bsub, psub, etc...]):
